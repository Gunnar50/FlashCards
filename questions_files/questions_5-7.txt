Explanation: RADIUS is an open-standard AAA protocol using UDP port 1645 or 1812 for authentication and UDP port 1646 or 1813 for accounting. It combines authentication and authorization into one process.
!
What is the one major difference between local AAA authentication and using the login local command when configuring device access authentication?
The login local command requires the administrator to manually configure the usernames and passwords, but local AAA authentication does not.
Local AAA authentication allows more than one user account to be configured, but login local does not.
Local AAA authentication provides a way to configure backup methods of authentication, but login local does not.
The login local command uses local usernames and passwords stored on the router, but local AAA authentication does not.

What are three characteristics of superviews in the Cisco role-based CLI access feature? (Choose three.)
A user uses the command enable view superview-name to enter a superview.
A user uses a superview to configure commands inside associated CLI views.
Commands cannot be configured for a superview.
Level 15 privilege access is used to configure a new superview.
Deleting a superview does not delete the associated CLI views.
A single CLI view can be shared within multiple superviews.
.
multiple
3, 5, 6

Explanation: Cisco role-based Superviews have several specific characteristics: – A single CLI view can be shared within multiple superviews. – Commands cannot be configured for a superview. An administrator must add commands to the CLI view and add that CLI view to the superview. – Users who are logged into a superview can access all the commands that are configured for any of the CLI views that are part of the superview. – Each superview has a password that is used to switch between superviews or from a CLI view to a superview. – Deleting a superview does not delete the associated CLI views. The CLI views remain available to be assigned to another superview. – Only a root view user can configure a new view and add or remove commands from the existing views.

Local implementation supports only TACACS+ servers.
Local implementation cannot provide secure authentication.
Local implementation does not scale well.
Local implementation supports only RADIUS servers.
.
single
3

Explanation: One of the purposes of AAA is to provide secure authentication to network devices. Local implementation does not use RADIUS or TACACS+ servers. It relies on a local database to authenticate all users. This can be a problem in a network that has many devices with hundreds of users or more.

Which task is necessary to encrypt the transfer of data between the ACS server and the AAA-enabled router?
Configure the key exactly the same way on the server and the router.
Specify the single-connection keyword.
Create a VPN tunnel between the server and the router.
Use identical reserved ports on the server and the router.
.
single
1

Explanation: The key command is used to configure the shared secret key that is used for encryption. The key must be configured the exact same way on the router and on the ACS server. The creation of a VPN tunnel is unnecessary. Neither the configuration of ports nor the use of the single-connection command has any effect on encryption.

A network engineer is implementing security on all company routers. Which two commands must be issued to force authentication via the password 1A2b3C for all OSPF-enabled interfaces in the backbone area of the company network? (Choose two.)
area 0 authentication message-digest
ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 1A2b3C
username OSPF password 1A2b3C
enable password 1A2b3C
area 1 authentication message-digest
.
multiple
1, 2

Explanation: The two commands that are necessary to configure authentication via the password 1A2b3C for all OSPF-enabled interfaces in the backbone area (Area 0) of the company network would be ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 1A2b3C and area 0 authentication message-digest. The option area 1 authentication message-digest is incorrect because it refers to Area 1, not Area 0. The option enable password 1A2b3C is incorrect because it would set the privileged EXEC mode password instead of the OSPF authentication password. The option username OSPF password 1A2b3C is required to create a username database in a router, which is not required with OSPF authentication.
