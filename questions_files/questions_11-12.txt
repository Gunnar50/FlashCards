What are two characteristics of both IPS and IDS sensors? (Choose two.)
neither introduce latency or jitter
both use signatures to detect patterns
both are deployed inline in the data stream
both can stop trigger packets
both can detect atomic patterns
.
multiple

Explanation: IDS sensors work off line and are passive. They add very little latency, however they cannot stop trigger packets. An IPS can stop trigger packets but because they are installed inline they add some latency and jitter to the traffic.

What is an advantage of using an IPS?
It is installed outside of the data traffic flow.
It does not impact network traffic if there is a sensor overload.
It can stop trigger packets.
It has no impact on network latency.

What is a characteristic of an IDS?
It can affect network performance by introducing latency and jitter.
It often requires assistance from other network devices to respond to an attack.
It is installed inline with the network traffic flow.
It can be configured to drop trigger packets that are associated with a connection.

What are two characteristics of an IPS operating in promiscuous mode? (Choose two.)
It can stop malicious traffic from reaching the intended target for all types of attacks.
It sits directly in the path of the traffic flow.
It requires the assistance of another network device to respond to an attack.
It does not impact the flow of packets in forwarded traffic.
It sends alerts and drops any malicious packets.
.
multiple
3, 4

Explanation: An advantage of an IPS operating in promiscuous mode is that the sensor does not affect the packet flow with the forwarded traffic. A disadvantage is that the sensor cannot stop malicious traffic from reaching its intended target for certain types of attacks, such as atomic attacks (single-packet attacks).

Which IPS signature trigger category uses a decoy server to divert attacks away from production devices?
honey pot-based detection
policy-based detection
pattern-based detection
anomaly-based detection
.
single
1

Explanation: Honey pot-based detection uses a decoy server to attract attacks and to divert attacks away from production devices. Use of a honey pot can give administrators time to analyze incoming attacks and malicious traffic patterns to tune sensor signatures.

What situation will generate a true negative IPS alarm type?
normal traffic that generates a false alarm
a verified security incident that is detected
a known attack that is not detected
normal traffic that is correctly being ignored and forwarded
.
single
4

Explanation: The true negative alarm type is used when normal network traffic flows through an interface. Normal traffic should not, and does not generate an actual alarm. A true negative indicates that benign normal traffic is correctly being ignored and forwarded without generating an alert.

What is provided by the fail open and close functionality of Snort IPS?
provides the ability to automatically disable problematic signatures that routinely cause false positives and pass traffic
blocks the traffic flow or bypasses IPS checking in the event of an IPS engine failure

keeps track of the health of the Snort engine that is running in the service container

What is a network tap?
a Cisco technology that provides statistics on packets flowing through a router or multilayer switch
a technology used to provide real-time reporting and long-term analysis of security events
a feature supported on Cisco switches that enables the switch to copy frames and forward them to an analysis device
a passive device that forwards all traffic and physical layer errors to an analysis device
.

Explanation: A network tap is used to capture traffic for monitoring the network. The tap is typically a passive splitting device implemented inline on the network and forwards all traffic, including physical layer errors, to an analysis device.

Which statement describes the function of the SPAN tool used in a Cisco switch?
It is a secure channel for a switch to send logging to a syslog server.
It provides interconnection between VLANs over multiple switches.
It supports the SNMP trap operation on a switch.
It copies the traffic from one switch port and sends it to another switch port that is connected to a monitoring device.
.
single
4

Explanation: To analyze network traffic passing through a switch, switched port analyzer (SPAN) can be used. SPAN can send a copy of traffic from one port to another port on the same switch where a network analyzer or monitoring device is connected. SPAN is not required for syslog or SNMP. SPAN is used to mirror traffic, while syslog and SNMP are configured to send data directly to the appropriate server.

What is an advantage of HIPS that is not provided by IDS?
HIPS provides quick analysis of events through detailed logging.
HIPS deploys sensors at network entry points and protects critical network segments.
HIPS monitors network processes and protects critical files.
HIPS protects critical system resources and monitors operating system processes.
.
single
4

Explanation: Network-based IDS (NIDS) sensors are typically deployed in offline mode. They do not protect individual hosts. Host-based IPS (HIPS) is software installed on a single host to monitor and analyze suspicious activity. It can monitor and protect operating system and critical system processes that are specific to that host. HIPS can be thought of as a combination of antivirus software, antimalware software, and a firewall.
!
What information must an IPS track in order to detect attacks matching a composite signature?
the total number of packets in the attack
the state of packets related to the attack
the attacking period used by the attacker
the network bandwidth consumed by all packets
.
single
2

Explanation: A composite signature is called a stateful signature. It identifies a sequence of operations distributed across multiple hosts over an arbitrary period of time. Because this type of attack involves multiple packets, an IPS sensor must maintain the state information. However, an IPS sensor cannot maintain the state information indefinitely. A composite signature is configured with a time period to maintain the state for the specific attack when it is first detected. Thus, an IPS may not be able to maintain all the information related to an attack such as total number of packets, total length of attack time, and the amount of bandwidth consumed by the attack.
