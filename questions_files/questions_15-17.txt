guarantees data has not changed in transit
provides data encryption

Explanation: Digital signatures are a mathematical technique used to provide three basic security services. Digital signatures have specific properties that enable entity authentication and data integrity. In addition, digital signatures provide nonrepudiation of the transaction. In other words, the digital signature serves as legal proof that the data exchange did take place.

What popular encryption algorithm requires that both the sender and receiver know a pre-shared key?

MD5
AES
HMAC
.

Explanation: MD5 is a hashing algorithm that guarantees that no one intercepted the message and altered it. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a popular symmetric encryption algorithm where each communicating party needs to know the pre-shared key. Public key infrastructure (PKI) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm based on the assumption that the two communicating parties have not previously shared a secret key. HMAC is a hash message authentication code that guarantees that the message is not a forgery and actually comes from the authentic source.

Two users must authenticate each other using digital certificates and a CA. Which option describes the CA authentication procedure?
The users must obtain the certificate of the CA and then their own certificate.
The CA is always required, even after user verification is complete.
CA certificates are retrieved out-of-band using the PSTN, and the authentication is done in-band over a network.
After user verification is complete, the CA is no longer required, even if one of the involved certificates expires.
.

Explanation: When two users must authenticate each other using digital certificates and CA, both users must obtain their own digital certificate from a CA. They submit a certificate request to a CA, and the CA will perform a technical verification by calling the end user (out-of-band). Once the request is approved, the end user retrieves the certificate over the network (in-band) and installs the certificate on the system. After both users have installed their certificate, they can perform authentication by sending their certificate to each other. Each site will use the public key of the CA to verify the validity of the certificate; no CA is involved at this point. If both certificates are verified, both users can now authenticate each other.

The following message was encrypted using a Caesar cipher with a key of 2: fghgpf vjg ecuvng What is the plaintext message?
invade the castle
defend the castle
defend the region
invade the region
.
single
2

Explanation: The Caesar cipher was a simple substitution cipher. In this example, if the key is 2, the letter d was moved two spaces to the right, resulting in an encoded message that used the letter f in place of the letter d. The letter g would be the substitute for the letter e, and so on. So, the resulting plaintext is f=d, g=e, h=f, g=e, p=n, f=d, v=t, j=h, g=e, e=c, c=a, u=s, v=t, n=l, g=e.​

In a hierarchical CA topology, where can a subordinate CA obtain a certificate for itself?
from the root CA or another subordinate CA at a higher level
from the root CA or another subordinate CA at the same level
from the root CA or from self-generation
from the root CA only
from the root CA or another subordinate CA anywhere in the tree
.

Explanation: In a hierarchical CA topology, CAs can issue certificates to end users and to subordinate CAs, which in turn issue their certificates to end users, other lower level CAs, or both. In this way, a tree of CAs and end users is built in which every CA can issue certificates to lower level CAs and end users. Only the root CA can issue a self-signing certificate in a hierarchical CA topology.
