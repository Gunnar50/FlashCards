Why are traditional network security perimeters not suitable for the latest consumer-based network endpoint devices?
These devices are not managed by the corporate IT department.
These devices pose no risk to security as they are not directly connected to the corporate network.
These devices connect to the corporate network through public wireless networks.
These devices are more varied in type and are portable.

Explanation: Traditional network security has two major focuses: (1) end point protection using antivirus software and enabling the personal firewall, and (2) network border protection with firewalls, proxy servers, and network packet scanning devices or software. This type of protection is not suited for the new network devices that are mobile, frequently access cloud storage, and may be a personal device.

Two devices that are connected to the same switch need to be totally isolated from one another. Which Cisco switch security feature will provide this isolation?
PVLAN Edge
DTP
SPAN
BPDU guard
.
single
1

Explanation: The PVLAN Edge feature does not allow one device to see traffic that is generated by another device. Ports configured with the PVLAN Edge feature are also known as protected ports. BPDU guard prevents unauthorized connectivity to a wired Layer 2 switch. SPAN is port mirroring to capture data from one port or VLAN and send that data to another port. DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol) is automatically enabled on some switch models to create a trunk if the attached device is configured for trunking. Cisco recommends disabling DTP as a best practice.

What is the behavior of a switch as a result of a successful CAM table attack?
The switch will drop all received frames.
The switch interfaces will transition to the error-disabled state.
The switch will forward all received frames to all other ports.
The switch will shut down.
.
single
3

Explanation: As a result of a CAM table attack, a switch can run out of memory resources to store MAC addresses. When this happens, no new MAC addresses can be added to the CAM table and the switch will forward all received frames to all other ports. This would allow an attacker to capture all traffic that is flooded by the switch.

What is the result of a DHCP starvation attack?
Legitimate clients are unable to lease IP addresses.
Clients receive IP address assignments from a rogue DHCP server.
The attacker provides incorrect DNS and default gateway information to clients.
The IP addresses assigned to legitimate clients are hijacked.
.
single
1

Explanation: DCHP starvation attacks are launched by an attacker with the intent to create a DoS for DHCP clients. To accomplish this goal, the attacker uses a tool that sends many DHCPDISCOVER messages to lease the entire pool of available IP addresses, thus denying them to legitimate hosts.
