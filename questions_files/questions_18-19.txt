Explanation: The crypto map command is used to finish creating the IPsec security policy by doing the following
!
Router R1 has configured ISAKMP policies numbered 1, 5, 9, and 203. Router R2 only has default policies. How will R1 attempt to negotiate the IKE Phase 1 ISAKMP tunnel with R2?
R1 and R2 cannot match policies because the policy numbers are different.
R1 will attempt to match policy #1 with the most secure matching policy on R2.
R1 will try to match policy #203 with the most secure default policy on R2.
R1 will begin to try to match policy #1 with policy #65514 on R2.
.
single
2

Explanation: Peers will attempt to negotiate using the policy with the lowest number (highest priority). Peers do not require matching priority numbers. R1 will attempt to use the most secure default policy (policy #1). If R2 has a matching policy, then R1 and R2 can successfully negotiate the IKE Phase 1 ISAKMP tunnel. If there is no agreement to use the most secure default policy, R1 will attempt to use the next most secure policy.

When the CLI is used to configure an ISR for a site-to-site VPN connection, what is the purpose of the crypto map command in interface configuration mode?
to configure the transform set
to bind the interface to the ISAKMP policy
to force IKE Phase 1 negotiations to begin
to negotiate the SA policy
.
single
2

Explanation: The crypto map command, along with the name of the policy, is used to bind the interface to the ISAKMP policy created previously. A transform set is configured using the crypto ipsec transform-set command. Interesting traffic between peers forces IKE Phase 1 negotiations to begin. Peers negotiate the ISAKMP SA policy in step 2 of IPsec negotiations.

Which statement describes the effect of key length in deterring an attacker from hacking through an encryption key?
The length of a key does not affect the degree of security.
The shorter the key, the harder it is to break.
The length of a key will not vary between encryption algorithms.
The longer the key, the more key possibilities exist.
.
single
4

Explanation: While preventing brute-force attacks and other forced decryption concerns, the longer the key length, the harder it is to break. A 64-bit key can take one year to break with a sophisticated computer, while a 128-bit key may take 1019 years to decrypt. Different encryption algorithms will provide varying key lengths for implementation.

How is "tunneling" accomplished in a VPN?
New headers from one or more VPN protocols encapsulate the original packets.
All packets between two hosts are assigned to a single physical medium to ensure that the packets are kept private.
Packets are disguised to look like other types of traffic so that they will be ignored by potential attackers.
A dedicated circuit is established between the source and destination devices for the duration of the connection.
.
single
1

Explanation: Packets in a VPN are encapsulated with the headers from one or more VPN protocols before being sent across the third party network. This is referred to as "tunneling". These outer headers can be used to route the packets, authenticate the source, and prevent unauthorized users from reading the contents of the packets.

Which two scenarios are examples of remote access VPNs? (Choose two.)
All users at a large branch office can access company resources through a single VPN connection.
A small branch office with three employees has a Cisco ASA that is used to create a VPN connection to the HQ.
A toy manufacturer has a permanent VPN connection to one of its parts suppliers.
A mobile sales agent is connecting to the company network via the Internet connection at a hotel.
An employee who is working from home uses VPN client software on a laptop in order to connect to the company network.

Which is a requirement of a site-to-site VPN?
It requires hosts to use VPN client software to encapsulate traffic.
It requires the placement of a VPN server at the edge of the company network.
It requires a VPN gateway at each end of the tunnel to encrypt and decrypt traffic.
It requires a client/server architecture.
.
single
3

Explanation: Site-to-site VPNs are static and are used to connect entire networks. Hosts have no knowledge of the VPN and send TCP/IP traffic to VPN gateways. The VPN gateway is responsible for encapsulating the traffic and forwarding it through the VPN tunnel to a peer gateway at the other end which decapsulates the traffic.

Consider the following configuration on a Cisco ASA: crypto ipsec transform-set ESP-DES-SHA esp-des esp-sha-hmac. What is the purpose of this command?
to define the ISAKMP parameters that are used to establish the tunnel
to define the encryption and integrity algorithms that are used to build the IPsec tunnel
to define what traffic is allowed through and protected by the tunnel
to define only the allowed encryption algorithms
.
single
2

Explanation: The transform set is negotiated during Phase 2 of the IPsec VPN connection process. The purpose of the transform set is to define what encryption and authentication schemes can be used. The device doing the VPN initiation offers the acceptable transform sets in order of preference, in this case, ESP authentication using DES for encryption or ESP authentication using SHA-HMAC authentication and integrity for the data payload. Remember that ESP provides confidentiality with encryption and integrity with authentication. The ESP-DES-SHA is the name of the transform set. The parameters that follow (esp-des and esp-sha-hmac) are the specific types of encryption or authentication that is supported by the ASA for the VPN tunnel that uses this transform set.
