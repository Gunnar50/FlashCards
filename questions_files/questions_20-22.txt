Explanation: An integrity checking system can report login and logout activities. Network scanning can detect user names, groups, and shared resources by scanning listening TCP ports. Password cracking is used to test and detect weak passwords. Vulnerability scanning can detect potential weaknesses in a system, such as misconfigurations, default passwords, or DoS attack targets.

What are three characteristics of SIEM? (Choose three.)
can be implemented as software or as a service
Microsoft port scanning tool designed for Windows
examines logs and events from systems and applications to detect security threats
consolidates duplicate event data to minimize the volume of gathered data

1, 3, 4

Explanation: Security Information Event Management (SIEM) is a technology that provides real-time reporting and long-term analysis of security events. SIEM provides the ability to search logs and events from disparate systems or applications to detect threats. SIEM aggregates duplicate events to reduce the volume of event data. SIEM can be implemented as software or as a managed.service. SuperScan is a Microsoft Windows port scanning tool that runs on most versions of Windows.Tools, such as Nmap and SuperScan, can provide effective penetration testing on a network and determine network vulnerabilities while helping to anticipate possible attack mechanisms.

What are three characteristics of the ASA routed mode? (Choose three.)
This mode is referred to as a “bump in the wire.”
In this mode, the ASA is invisible to an attacker.
The interfaces of the ASA separate Layer 3 networks and require different IP addresses in different subnets.
It is the traditional firewall deployment mode.
This mode does not support VPNs, QoS, or DHCP Relay.
NAT can be implemented between connected networks.
.
multiple
3, 4, 6

Explanation: Routed mode is the traditional mode for deploying a firewall where there are two or more interfaces that separate Layer 3 networks. The ASA is considered to be a router hop in the network and can perform NAT between connected networks. Routed mode supports multiple interfaces. Each interface is on a different subnet and requires an IP address on that subnet.

In which two instances will traffic be denied as it crosses the ASA 5505 device? (Choose two.)
traffic originating from the inside network going to the DMZ network
traffic originating from the inside network going to the outside network
traffic originating from the outside network going to the DMZ network
traffic originating from the DMZ network going to the inside network
traffic originating from the outside network going to the inside network
.
multiple
4, 5

Explanation: When an ASA 5505 device is being utilized, traffic is denied as it travels from a lower security zone to a higher security zone. The highest security zone is the internal network, the DMZ is usually the next highest, and the outside network is the lowest. Traffic is only allowed to move from a lower security level to a higher if it is in response to originating traffic within the higher security zone.
!
Refer to the exhibit. Based on the security levels of the interfaces on the ASA, what statement correctly describes the flow of traffic allowed on the interfaces?
Traffic that is sent from the LAN and the Internet to the DMZ is considered inbound.
Traffic that is sent from the DMZ and the Internet to the LAN is considered outbound.
Traffic that is sent from the LAN to the DMZ is considered inbound.
Traffic that is sent from the LAN to the DMZ is considered is considered inbound.
Traffic that is sent from the DMZ and the LAN to the Internet is considered outbound.

Explanation: When traffic moves from an interface with a higher security level to an interface with a lower security level, it is considered outbound traffic. Conversely, traffic that moves from an interface with a lower security level to an interface with a higher security level is considered inbound traffic.
!
Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator is configuring the security level for the ASA. Which statement describes the default result if the administrator tries to assign the Inside interface with the same security level as the DMZ interface?
The ASA allows inbound traffic initiated on the Internet to the DMZ, but not to the Inside interface.
The ASA console will display an error message.
The ASA will not allow traffic in either direction between the Inside interface and the DMZ.
The ASA allows traffic from the Inside to the DMZ, but blocks traffic initiated on the DMZ to the Inside interface.
.

20-22/9.jpg
Explanation: Multiple interfaces in an ASA can be assigned the same security level. To allow connectivity between interfaces with the same security levels, the same-security-traffic permit inter-interface global configuration command is required. Traffic from the higher level network to the lower level network is allowed by default. However, traffic initiated on the lower level network is denied access to the higher level network by default.

What interface configuration command is used on an ASA to request an IP address from an upstream DSL device?
ip address ip-address netmask
ip address dhcp setroute

ip address pppoe
.
single

Explanation: Configuring IP addresses on interfaces can be done manually using the ip address command. It can also be accomplished by using DHCP when an interface is connecting to an upstream device providing DHCP services. PPPoE is used when an interface is connecting to an upstream DSL device providing point-to-point connectivity over Ethernet services. The dhcpd address IP_address1 [ -IP_address2 ] if_name command is used to establish the IP address pool on a DHCP server.

Explanation: From the configuration, the source of IP address translation is the subnet 192.168.5.0/27 and the mapped address is the outside interface. This is an example of dynamic PAT. Dynamic NAT, dynamic PAT, and static NAT are referred to as “network object NAT” because the configuration requires network objects to be configured. Twice NAT identifies both the source and destination address in a single rule ( nat command), and it is used when configuring remote-access IPsec and SSL VPNs.​
