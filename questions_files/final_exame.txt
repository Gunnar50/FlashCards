Which statement describes a difference between the Cisco ASA IOS CLI feature and the router IOS CLI feature?
ASA uses the ? command whereas a router uses the help command to receive help on a brief description and the syntax of a command.
To use a show command in a general configuration mode, ASA can use the command directly whereas a router will need to enter the do command before issuing the show command.
To complete a partially typed command, ASA uses the Ctrl+Tab key combination whereas a router uses the Tab key.
To indicate the CLI EXEC mode, ASA uses the % symbol whereas a router uses the # symbol.
